# GMM-Regression
Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are widely used in data mining, pattern recognition, machine learning, 
and statistical analysis; where, usually, their parameters are determined by maximum likelihood 
and the EM algorithm. The key idea is to model the joint probability density function of 
the data (inputs and ouputs included) using a Gaussian mixture model. 
Then we obtain the regression value by using the concept of 
conditional expectation (see enclosed PDF file).

These scripts require NETLAB toolbox for Matlab.
